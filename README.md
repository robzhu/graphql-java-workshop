You'll need [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and [GraphQL Playground](https://electronjs.org/apps/graphql-playground).

```
git clone https://github.com/robzhu/graphql-java-workshop
cd graphql-java-workshop
mvn:jetty
```

Make sure there are no errors in the console. Open GraphQL Playground and open the endpoint: http://localhost:8080/graphql.
